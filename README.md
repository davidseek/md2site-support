## Welcome
md2site is a `markdown to static website` generator. You define the content in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), select a template, and the generator creates a website from your markdown and hosts it for you. You can then either use the `.md2site.com` url or link your own domain.
